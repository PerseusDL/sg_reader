              <p>After a secondary tense, the subjunctive may be used in place of the

              <p><b>a.</b> In the narration of past
                events, the subjunctive sets forth a person's previous purpose in the form in which
                he conceived his purpose. Thus (<span class="foreign">τὰ
                πλοῖα</span>) <span class="foreign">Ἀβροκόμᾱς . . . κατέκαυσεν

                will burn the boats that Cyrus may not cross’ (<span class="foreign">ἵνα μὴ διαβῇ</span>), and is given in a kind of quotation. </p>
              <p>N.—Thucydides and Herodotus prefer this vivid subjunctive; the poets,
                Plato, and Xenophon, the optative. In Demosthenes, the subjunctive and optative are
                equally common. </p>
              <p><b>b.</b> When the purpose (or its
                effect) is represented as still continuing in the present. See the example in 2195.

              <p>The alternative construction of final clauses with subjunctive or

                optative. Observe that the subjunctive for the optative is relatively past, since
                the leading verb is past. </p>

              <p><b>a.</b> In some cases, especially

                <b>Connection of Final with Object Clauses</b>.—(1)
                Final clauses proper denote a purpose to accomplish or avert a result, which purpose
                is set forth in a definite action. (2) Object clauses after <span class="term">verbs of effort</span> consider means to accomplish or avert a result; the action
                of the subordinate clause is the <i>object
                purposed</i>. Such clauses are <i>incomplete</i>
                final clauses, because, though the purpose is expressed, the action taken to effect
                the purpose is not expressed. (3) Object clauses after <span class="term">verbs of
                  fearing</span> deprecate an undesired result or express fear that a desired result
                may not be accomplished. According to the form of expression employed, the
                construction of these three kinds of clauses may differ in varying degree or be
                identical. Thus compare these usages of Attic prose: </p>

              <p>There are two main forms of result clauses: <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span> with the infinitive and <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span> with a finite verb. With the infinitive, the
                negative is generally <span class="foreign">μή</span>; with a
                finite verb, <span class="foreign">οὐ</span>. On the use in
                indirect discourse and on irregularities, see <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.35.html#s2759" title="">2759</a>. </p>

              <p>Consecutive <span class="foreign">ὡς</span> occurs
                almost always with the infinitive (chiefly in Herodotus, Xenophon, Aeschylus, and
                Sophocles); with a finite verb occasionally in Herodotus and Xenophon. With the
                infinitive, the orators and Thucydides (except 7. <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.1_div2.1.html#s34" title="">34</a>) have <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span>. </p>

              <p>Consecutive <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span>
                  (<span class="foreign">ὡς</span>) with a finite verb does not
                occur in Homer, who uses coördination instead (cp. <span class="foreign">δέ</span> in A <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.1_div2.1.html#s10" title="">10</a>). Two cases of <span class="foreign">ὥς τε</span>
                occur with the infinitive (I 42; <span class="titlem">
                    <span class="foreign">ζ</span>
                  </span> 21 may mean <span class="gloss">and so</span>), where the
                infinitive might stand alone, since Homer uses the infinitive to denote an intended
                or possible result. </p>

            <div class="smythp" id="s2254"><h5>2254</h5>
              <p>A clause with <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span>
                and the infinitive is merely added to the clause containing the main thought in
                order to explain it. The consequence is stated without any distinction of time and
                only with difference of stage of action. </p>
              <p><b>a.</b> Since the infinitive
                expresses merely the abstract verbal idea, its use with <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span> (as with <span class="foreign">πρίν</span>) outside of indirect discourse cannot explicitly denote a <i>fact</i>. By its datival nature (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.21.html#s1969" title="">1969</a>), the infinitive is simply a complement to,
                or explanation of, the governing word. <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span> is one of the means to reinforce this explanatory office of the
                infinitive. The origin of its use is suggested by the comparison with <span class="foreign">ὅσος</span>
                <span class="gloss">sufficient for</span>, <span class="foreign">οἷος</span>
                <span class="gloss">capable of</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.21.html#s2003" title="">2003</a>) and the infinitive, which was not <i>originally</i> dependent on these words. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="smythp" id="s2255"><h5>2255</h5>
              <p>A clause with <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span>
                and a finite verb contains the main thought, and is often so loosely connected with
                the leading verb as to be practically independent and coördinate. <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span> may thus be simply introductory and
                take any construction found in an independent sentence. The consequence expresses
                distinctions of time and stage of action. </p>

                <p>A clause of result with <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span> stating that something may occur in consequence of an <i>intention</i>, <i>tendency</i>, <i>capacity</i>, and in
                  general in consequence of the <i>nature</i> of an
                  object or action, is regularly expressed by the infinitive. When a consequence is
                  stated without affirming or denying its actual occurrence, the infinitive is in
                  place. The infinitive <i>may</i> therefore denote
                  a fact, but does not explicitly state this to be the case; and is, in general,
                  permissible in all cases where the attainment of the result is expected, natural,
                  or possible, and its actual occurrence is not emphasized; as it is emphasized by
                  the indicative. </p>

                  <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span> with the infinitive does
                  not state a particular fact. The infinitive is preferred in clauses containing or
                  implying a negative. <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span> with
                  the indicative is preferred after <span class="foreign">εἰς
                    τοῦτο ἥκει</span> and like phrases when affirmative (cp. <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.29.html#s2265" title="">2265</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.29.html#s2266" title="">2266</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.29.html#s2274" title="">2274</a>). </p>

                <p>Greek possesses a great variety of ways to join protasis and
                  apodosis, but certain types, as in English, are more common than others and have
                  clear and distinct meanings. In the case of some of the less usual types the exact
                  shade of difference cannot be accurately known to us; as indeed to the Greeks
                  themselves they were often used with no essential difference from the conventional

                  <p>Simple present or past conditions simply <i>state</i> a supposition with no implication as to its
                    reality or probability. The protasis has the indicative, the apodosis has
                    commonly the indicative, but also any other form of the simple sentence
                    appropriate to the thought. </p>

                  <p><b>a.</b> This form of condition
                    corresponds to the logical formula <i>if this is
                      so</i>, <i>then that is so; if this is not
                      so, then that is not so; if A = B</i>, <i>then C = D</i>. The truth of the conclusion depends solely on the truth of
                    the condition, which <span id="smyth-pb-d0e282305"/> is not implied in any way. In
                    these conditions something is supposed to be true only in order to draw the
                    consequence that something else is true. </p>
                  <p><b>b.</b> The conditional clause
                    may express what the writer knows is physically impossible. Even when the
                    supposition <i>is</i> true according to the
                    real opinion of the writer, this form of condition is employed. In such cases
                      <span class="foreign">εἴπερ</span> is often used for
                      <span class="foreign">εἰ</span>. Both <span class="foreign">εἰ</span> and <span class="foreign">εἴπερ</span> sometimes have a causal force (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.29.html#s2246" title="">2246</a>); cp. <span class="gloss">si quidem</span> and <span class="gloss">quia</span>. </p>
                  <p><b>c.</b> The simple condition is
                    particular or general. When the protasis has <span class="foreign">εἴ τις</span> and the apodosis a present indicative, the
                    simple condition has a double meaning referring both to an individual case and
                    to a rule of action. When a present general condition is distinctly expressed,
                      <span class="foreign">ἐά̄ν</span> with the subjunctive is
                    used (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.29.html#s2337" title="">2337</a>.) </p>

                  <p>There are many possible combinations of present and past conditions
                    with different forms of the protasis and apodosis. Protasis and apodosis may be
                    in different tenses, and present and future may be combined. </p>

                <p>Future conditions set forth suppositions the fulfilment of which is
                  still undecided. There are two main forms of future conditions: </p>
                <p>More Vivid Future conditions. </p>
                <p>Less Vivid Future conditions. </p>
                <p>A variety of the first class is the Emotional Future (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.29.html#s2328" title="">2328</a>). </p>
                <p>Future conditions may be particular or general (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.29.html#s2293" title="">2293</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.29.html#s2294" title="">2294</a>). </p>

                <p>The difference between the More Vivid Future and the Less Vivid
                  Future, like the difference between <i>if I</i>
                    (<span class="gloss">shall</span>) <span class="gloss">do this</span>
                  and <span class="gloss">if I should do this</span>, depends on the mental
                  attitude of the speaker. With the Vivid Future the <span id="smyth-pb-d0e283987"/>
                  speaker sets forth a thought as prominent and distinct in his mind; and for any
                  one or more of various reasons. Thus, he may (and generally does) regard the
                  conclusion as more likely to be realized; but even an impossible (2322 c) or dreaded result may be expressed by
                  this form if the speaker chooses to picture the result vividly and distinctly. The
                  More Vivid Future is thus used whenever the speaker clearly desires to be graphic,
                  impressive, emphatic, and to anticipate a future result with the distinctness of
                  the present. </p>
                <p>The Less Vivid Future deals with suppositions less distinctly
                  conceived and of less immediate concern to the speaker, mere assumed or imaginary
                  cases. This is a favourite construction in Greek, and is often used in stating
                  suppositions that are merely possible and often impossible; but the form of the
                  condition itself does not imply an expectation of the speaker that the conclusion
                  may <i>possibly</i> be realized. The difference
                  between the two forms, therefore, is not an inherent difference between <i>probable</i> realization in the one case and <i>possible</i> realization in the other. The same
                  thought may often be expressed in either form without any essential difference in
                  meaning. The only difference is, therefore, often that of temperament, tone, or
                  style. </p>

                  rarely used in successive sentences. In most such cases the difference lies merely
                  in the degree of distinctness and emphasis of the expression used; but where the
                  speaker wishes to show that the conclusion is expected or desired, he uses

                    St. John). <span id="smyth-pb-d0e284159"/> Modern English substitutes the present for
                    the more exact future in ordinary future conditions of this class; and often
                    uses <i>shall</i> in the protasis with an

                <p><b>a.</b> By reason of the past
                  apodosis, the optative in the protasis refers to the past. Only in this use (and
                  when the optative in indirect discourse represents a past indicative) does the
                  optative refer distinctly to the past. </p>
                <p><b>b.</b> The present subjunctive
                  and optative view the action as continuing (not completed); the aorist subjunctive
                  and optative, as simply occurring (completed). The tenses of the protasis have no
                  time of themselves, but usually the action of the present is relatively
                  contemporaneous with, the action of the aorist relatively antecedent to, the

                  which distinguishes the special kind of general condition from the two forms of

                    feeling. Most of these combinations, though less frequent than the ordinary
                    forms, are no less “regular.” Shift of mental attitude is a known fact of all
                    speech, though the relation of cause to effect must not be obscured. A speaker
                    or writer, having begun his sentence with a protasis of one type, may alter the
                    course of his thought: with the result that he may conclude with an apodosis of
                    another form, in some cases even with an apodosis “unsymmetrical” with the
                    protasis and logically dependent upon a protasis that is only suggested by the
                    form actually adopted. Since either protasis or apodosis may choose the form of
                    expression best suited to the meaning, the student should beware of thinking
                    that conditional sentences invariably follow a conventional pattern, departure
                    from which is to be counted as violation of rule. Some combinations are less

                  antecedent to that of the leading verb when the action of the dependent clause
                  takes place before the action of the main clause. In clauses of contemporaneous

                    . The adverbial and original use appears also in Homer wherever <span class="foreign">πρίν</span> occurs with the indicative, the
                    anticipatory (futural) subjunctive (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.20.html#s1810" title="">1810</a>), or the optative with <span class="foreign">κέ</span>. Thus, <span class="foreign">τὴν δ᾽ ἐγὼ οὐ λύ̄σω· πρίν μιν καὶ γῆρας ἕπεισιν</span>

                    construction of the <i>conjunction</i>
                    <span class="foreign">πρίν</span> with the finite moods;
                    but in general only after Homer, who never uses the indicative, and the optative
                    only once (<span class="titlem">
                        <span class="foreign">Φ</span>
                      </span> 580), with <span class="foreign">πρίν</span>. The required sense was given by <span class="foreign">ἕως</span> or <span class="foreign">πρίν γ᾽ ὅτε δή</span>. A finite mood was first used of the future, and
                    after negative clauses (<span class="foreign">οὐ πρότερον
                    πρίν</span> like <span class="foreign">οὐ πρότερον
                    ἕως</span>).—Homer commonly uses the infinitive with <span class="foreign">πρίν</span> meaning <span class="gloss">before</span>
                    and <span class="gloss">until</span>. Here the infinitive (as with <span class="foreign">ὥστε</span>) simply states the abstract
                    verbal notion, and thus has no reference to differences of time or mood;
                      <span class="foreign">πρίν</span> being used almost like
                      <span class="foreign">πρό</span>
                    <span class="gloss">before</span> as <span class="foreign">πρὶν ἰδεῖν ῀ πρὸ τοῦ ἰδεῖν</span>
                    <span class="gloss">before seeing</span> (first in Xenophon). This early use
                    with the infinitive was, with some restrictions, retained in Attic, where the
                    infinitive <i>may</i> sometimes be used instead
                    of the finite verb. <span class="foreign">πρίν</span> came
                    more and more to take the subjunctive with <span class="foreign">ἄν</span> and to assume conditional relations (cp. <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.29.html#s2433" title="">2433</a>); while the use with the
                    infinitive was more and more confined to cases where the leading verb was
                    affirmative. </p>

                  <p>The comparative idea in <span class="foreign">πρίν</span> explains its negative force: an event A happened before
                    another event B, i.e. A occurred when B had <i>not
                      yet</i> (<span class="foreign">οὔπω</span>) occurred.
                    Because of its negative force <span class="foreign">πρίν</span> commonly takes the aorist in all the moods. The aorist has an
                    affinity for the negative because it marks simple and total negation of an
                    action regarded in its mere occurrence; whereas the imperfect with a negative
                    denotes resistance or refusal (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.20.html#s1896" title="">1896</a>) in respect of an action regarded as continuing. When <span class="foreign">πρίν</span> takes the present in any mood
                    the actions of the correlated clauses usually overlap. The present occurs
                    chiefly in the prose writers of the fourth century. <span id="smyth-pb-d0e292416"/>

                  of constructions. Thus,

                  comparisons. </p>
                <p><b>a.</b> The present and aorist
                  indicative and subjunctive (usually without <span class="foreign">ἄν</span>) are regularly used. The optative occurs only
                  with <span class="foreign">ὡς εἰ</span> or <span class="foreign">ὡς εἴ τε</span>. The verb of the apodosis may
                  sometimes be supplied from the main clause, and the sense may be satisfied in
                  other cases by supplying <i>as happens, as is the
                    case;</i> but as early as Homer the ellipsis was probably unconscious, as it
                  is in English <i>as if, as when</i>. Hence
                    <span class="foreign">ὡς εἰ, ὡς ὅτε</span> are scarcely to
                  be distinguished from <span class="foreign">ὡς</span>. </p>
                <p><b>b.</b> The tense of the main
                  clause may be primary or secondary without influence on the construction. Cp. <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.20.html#s1935" title="">1935</a> and 1935 a. </p>

                <p>
                  <span class="foreign">ὡς</span> is common in Homer with the
                  subjunctive (without <span class="foreign">ἄν</span>)
                  depending on the verb of the introductory clause, which is usually past. The
                  simile may begin with <span class="foreign">ὡς</span> or with
                  a demonstrative (<span class="foreign">οἱ</span> or <span class="foreign">τούς</span>) after which <span class="foreign">ὥς τε</span> is placed. Thus, <span class="foreign">ὡς δὲ λέων μήλοισιν ἀσημάντοισιν ἐπελθών . . . κακὰ φρονέων
                    ἐνορούσῃ, ὣς μὲν Θρήικας ἄνδρας ἐπῴχετο Τῡδέος υἱός</span>
                  <span class="gloss">and as a lion, coming on flocks without a shepherd</span>,

                  After the subjunctive with <span class="foreign">ὡς</span> or
                    <span class="foreign">ὡς ὅτε</span> an independent
                  indicative may follow (M 167, II <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.2_div2.4.html#s296" title="">296</a>). </p>

                  frequently with the optative; but usually without any finite verb. Thus, <span class="foreign">λᾱοὶ ἕπονθ᾽ ὡς εἴ τε μετὰ κτίλον ἕσπετο μῆλα</span>
                  <span class="gloss">the soldiers followed as sheep follow after the ram</span>

                <p>Attic poetry does not use the Epic and Lyric <span class="foreign">ὡς εἴ τε</span> for <span class="foreign">ὡς εἰ</span>. In Attic <span class="foreign">ὡς
