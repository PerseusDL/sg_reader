              grammatically independent of one another and generally united by a coördinating

          <div class="Section" id="body.1_div1.4_div2.26_div3.4"><h4>ASYNDETON</h4>
            

            <div class="smythp" id="s2165"><h5>2165</h5>
              <p>Two or more sentences (or words) independent in form and thought, but
                juxtaposed, i.e. coördinated without any connective, are <i>asyndetic</i> (from <span class="foreign">ἀσύνδετον</span>
                <span class="gloss">not bound together</span>), and such absence of connectives
                is called <span class="term">asyndeton</span>. </p>
              <p><b>a.</b> The absence of connectives
                in a language so rich in means of coördination as is Greek is more striking than in
                other languages. <i>Grammatical</i> asyndeton
                cannot always be separated from <i>rhetorical</i>
                asyndeton. Grammatical asyndeton is the absence of a conjunction where a connective
                might have been used without marked influence on the character of the thought; as
                especially in explanatory sentences (often after a preparatory word, usually a
                demonstrative) which take up the matter just introduced; also where, in place of a
                conjunction, a resumptive word, such as <span class="foreign">οὗτος, τοιοῦτος, τοσοῦτος, ἐνταῦθα, οὕτω</span>, etc., is employed. Rhetorical
                asyndeton is the absence of a conjunction where the following sentence contains a
                distinct advance in the thought and not a mere formal explanation appended to the
                foregoing sentence. Rhetorical asyndeton generally expresses emotion of some sort,
                and is the mark of liveliness, rapidity, passion, or impressiveness, of thought,
                each idea being set forth separately and distinctly. Thus, <span class="foreign">οὐκ ἀσεβής; οὐκ ὠμός; οὐκ ἀκάθαρτος; οὐ σῡκοφάντης</span>;
                  <span class="gloss">is he not impious? is he not brutal? is he not impure? is
                  he not a pettifogger?</span>

            <div class="smythp" id="s2166"><h5>2166</h5>
              <p>Asyndeton is frequent in rapid and lively descriptions. </p>

            <div class="smythp" id="s2168"><h5>2168</h5>
              <p>The term <i>parataxis</i> (<span class="foreign">παράταξις</span>
                <span class="gloss">arranging side by side</span>), as here employed, is
                restricted to the arrangement of two independent sentences side by side, though one
                is <i>in thought</i> subordinate to the other. </p>
              <p><b>a.</b> In Greek, <span class="foreign">παράταξις</span> means simply <i>coördination</i> in general, as <span class="foreign">ὑπόταξις</span> means <span class="gloss">subordination</span>. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="smythp" id="s2169"><h5>2169</h5>
              <p>In many cases parataxis is a common form of expression <span id="smyth-pb-d0e272383"/> not only in the earlier language of Homer, but also in Attic prose
                and poetry. </p>
              <p>So frequently in Attic prose with <span class="foreign">καί, τὲ . . . καί, ἅμα . . . καί, εὐθὺς . . . καί</span>, and
                with <span class="foreign">δέ</span> meaning <span class="gloss">for</span>. Thus, <span class="foreign">ἤδη δὲ
                  ἦν ὀψὲ . . . καὶ οἱ Κορίνθιοι πρύμναν ἐκρούοντο</span>
                <span class="gloss">it was already late and</span> (for <span class="gloss">when</span>) <span class="gloss">the Corinthians started to row astern</span>
                T. 1.50, <span class="foreign">καὶ ἤδη τε ἦν
                  περὶ πλήθουσαν ἀγορὰ̄ν καὶ ἔρχονται . . . κήρῡκες</span>
                <span class="gloss">and it was already about the time when the market-place fills
                  and</span> ( = <span class="gloss">when</span>) <span class="gloss">heralds arrived</span>

                , <span class="foreign">ἐπίστασθε μόνοι τῶν Ἑλλήνων τοὺς
                  ἀγαθοὺς ἄνδρας τῑμᾶν· εὑρήσετε δὲ . . . παρ᾽ ὑ̄μῖν στρατηγοὺς ἀγαθοὺς</span>
                  (<span class="foreign">ἀνακειμένους</span>) <i>you alone among the Greeks know how to honour men of merit; for you
                  will find statues of brave generals set up among you</i> Lyc. 51. Cp. <span class="foreign">σκέψασθε δέ</span>
                T. 1.143. </p>
              <p><b>a.</b> Temporal conjunctions, as
                  <span class="foreign">ἡνίκα</span>, are rarely used to
                introduce such clauses, which often indicate a sudden or decisive occurrence or
                simultaneous action. </p>
              <p><b>b.</b> Thucydides is especially
                fond of <span class="foreign">καί</span> or <span class="foreign">τέ</span> to coördinate two ideas, one of which
                is subordinate to the other. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="smythp" id="s2170"><h5>2170</h5>
              <p>Parataxis often occurs when a thought naturally subordinate is made
                independent for the sake of emphasis or liveliness. Such rhetorical parataxis occurs
                chiefly in the orators and in Pindar. So especially when <span class="foreign">μέν</span> and <span class="foreign">δέ</span> are used to coördinate two contrasted clauses, the former of which is
                logically subordinate and inserted to heighten the force of the latter. Here English
                uses <i>whereas</i>, <i>while</i>. Thus, 
                  <div class="citquote">
                    <blockquote class="quote"><p>αἰσχρόν ἐστι, εἰ ἐγὼ μὲν τὰ ἔργα τῶν ὑπὲρ
                      ὑ̄μῶν πόνων ὑπέμεινα, ὑ̄μεῖς δὲ μηδὲ τοὺς λόγους αὐτῶν ἀνέξεσθε</p></blockquote>
                    <span class="gloss">it is a shame that, whereas I have undergone the toil of
                      exertions in your cause, you will not endure even their recital</span>
                  </div>
                  <div class="citbibl">(D. 18.160)</div>
                . </p>
            </div>
            <div class="smythp" id="s2171"><h5>2171</h5>
              <p>There exist many traces in Greek of the use of the older coördination
                in place of which some form of subordination was adopted, either entirely or in
                part, in the later language. </p>
              <p><b>a.</b> Thus several relative
                pronouns and adverbs were originally demonstrative, and as such pointed either to
                the earlier or the later clause. So <span class="foreign">ὁ, ἡ,
                τό</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.16.html#s1105" title="">1105</a>, cp. <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.16.html#s1114" title="">1114</a>): <span class="foreign">τεύχεα δ᾽ ἐξενάριζε, τά οἱ πόρε χάλκεος αρης</span> (H <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.1_div2.6.html#s146" title="">146</a>) meant originally <i>he stripped him of his arms; these brazen Ares had
                  given him</i>. <span class="foreign">τέως</span>
                <span class="gloss">so long</span> is properly demonstrative, but has acquired a
                relative function in 
                  <div class="citquote">
                    <blockquote class="quote"><p>καὶ τέως ἐστὶ καιρός, ἀντιλάβεσθε τῶν
                      πρᾱγμάτων</p></blockquote>
                    <span class="gloss">and while there is time, take our policy in hand</span>
                  </div>

            </div>
            <div class="smythp" id="s2172"><h5>2172</h5>
              <p>Homer often places two thoughts in juxtaposition without any regard for
                logical connection. This is especially common with <span class="foreign">δέ, τέ, καί, αὐτάρ, ἀλλά</span>. Thus, <span class="foreign">πολὺς δ᾽ ὀρυμαγδὸς ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ἀνδρῶν ἠδὲ κυνῶν, ἀπό τέ
                σφισιν</span> (for <span class="foreign">οἶς</span>) 
                  <div class="citquote">
                    <blockquote class="quote"><p>ὕπνος ὄλωλεν</p></blockquote>
                    <span class="gloss">and there is loud clamour around him of men and of dogs,
                      and sleep is gone from them</span>
                  </div>
                  <div class="citbibl">(<span class="titlem">

                . </p>
              <p><b>a.</b> So also in clauses preceded
                by a relative word; as <span class="foreign">εἷος ὁ ταῦθ᾽ ὥρμαινε
                  . . ., ἐκ δ᾽ Ἑλένη θαλάμοιο . . . ἤλυθεν</span>
                <span class="gloss">while he was pondering on this</span>, (but) <span class="gloss">Helen came forth from her chamber</span>

                    <span class="foreign">δ</span>
                  </span> 120, <span class="foreign">ὅς κε θεοῖς
                  ἐπιπείθηται, μάλα τ᾽ ἔκλυον αὐτοῦ</span>
                <span class="gloss">whoever obeys the gods</span>, (and) <span class="gloss">him they hear</span>

              <p><b>b.</b> This use appears even in
                Attic prose; as <span class="foreign">οἰκου̂ͅσι δ᾽ ἐν μιᾷ τῶν
