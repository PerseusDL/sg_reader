              <b>Anacolūthon</b> (<span class="foreign">ἀνακόλουθον</span>
              <span class="gloss">inconsequent</span>), or grammatical inconsistency, is
              inadvertent or purposed deviation in the structure of a sentence by which a
              construction started at the beginning is not followed out consistently. Anacoluthon is
              sometimes real, sometimes <span id="smyth-pb-d0e338676"/> only slight or apparent. It is
              natural to Greek by reason of the mobility and elasticity of that language; but in
              English it could not be tolerated to an equal extent because our tongue—a speech of
              few inflected forms—is much more rigid than Greek. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="smythp" id="s3005"><h4>3005</h4>
            <p>Anacoluthon is, in general, caused either (<b>a</b>) by the choice of some form of expression more convenient or
              more effective than that for which the sentence was grammatically planned; at times,
              too, the disturbing influence is the insertion of a brief expression of an additional
              thought not foreseen at the start. Or (<b>b</b>) by
              the intrusion of some explanation requiring a parenthesis of such an extent that the
              connection is obscured or the continuation of the original structure made difficult.
              In this case the beginning may be repeated, or what has already been said may be
              summed up in a different grammatical form and sometimes with the addition of a
              resumptive particle, such as <span class="foreign">δή, οὖν</span>
              <span class="gloss">well then</span>, <span class="gloss">then</span>, <span class="gloss">as I was saying</span> (X.
                <span class="titlem">A.</span> 1.8.13, 3. 1. 20, X.
                <span class="titlem">C.</span> 3.3.9). So with <span class="foreign">δέ</span> (T. 8.29. 2). </p>

          <div class="smythp" id="s3006"><h4>3006</h4>
            <p>Anacoluthon usually produces the effect of naturalness and liveliness,
              sometimes of greater clearness (as after long parentheses), or of brevity, force, or
              concentration. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="smythp" id="s3007"><h4>3007</h4>
            <p>Anacoluthon is either natural or artificial. Natural anacoluthon is seen
              in the loose and discursive style of Herodotus; in the closely packed sentences of
              Thucydides, who hurries from one thought to another with the least expenditure of
              words; and in the slovenliness of Andocides. Artificial or rhetorical anacoluthon is
              the result of a deliberate purpose to give to written language the vividness,
              naturalness, and unaffected freedom of the easy flow of conversation, and is best seen
              in the dialogues of Plato. Such anacoluthon is usually graceful and free from
              obscurity. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="smythp" id="s3008"><h4>3008</h4>
            <p>There are very many forms of anacoluthon, e.g. </p>
            <p><b>a.</b> Many cases are due to the fact
              that a writer conforms his construction, not to the words which he has just used, but
              to another way in which the antecedent thought might have been expressed: the
              construction <span class="foreign">πρὸς τὸ νοούμενον</span> (or
                <span class="foreign">σημαινόμενον</span>) <span class="gloss">according to what is thought</span>. Cp. <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.22.html#s2148" title="">2148</a> and X.

                <span class="titlem">Hec.</span> 970. </p>
            <p><b>b.</b> Some cases are due to changes
              in the subject, as T. 1.18. 2. </p>
            <p><b>c.</b> Many cases occur in connection
              with the use of a participle (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.22.html#s2147" title="">2147</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.22.html#s2148" title="">2148</a>). </p>
            <p><b>d.</b> Coördinate clauses connected
              by <span class="foreign">τὲ . . . καί, καὶ . . . καί, οὔτε . . .
                οὔτε, ἢ . . . ἤ</span> often show anacoluthon, especially when a finite verb
              takes the place of a participle. Cp. 2147
                c, and T. 5.61. 4, 6. 32. 3, 7. 47. 1-2. </p>
            <p><b>e.</b> The nominative “in suspense”
              may stand at the head of a sentence instead of another case required by the following
              construction. This involves a redundant pronoun. Thus, <span class="foreign">Πρόξενος δὲ καὶ Μένων, ἐπείπερ εἰσὶν ὑ̄μέτεροι εὐεργέται . . .
                πέμψατε αὐτοὺς δεῦρο</span> (for <span class="foreign">Πρόξενον

                <span class="titlem">A.</span> 2.5.41. Cp. “The prince that feeds great
              natures, they will slay him:” Ben Jonson. </p>
            <p><b>f.</b> The accusative often stands
              absolutely when at the head of a sentence. Thus, <span class="foreign">ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ τῑμά̄ς γε . . ., τῶν μὲν μεθέξει καὶ γεύσεται ἑκών,
                ᾱ&lt;*&gt;`ς ἂν ἡγῆται ἀμείνω αὑτὸν ποιήσειν, ἃ̄ς δ᾽ . . . φεύξεται</span>

            <p><b>g.</b> A main clause may take the
              construction of a parenthetical clause (T. 4.93. 2). Here belongs
              the attraction into the relative clause of a verb that should have been principal. So
              after <span class="foreign">ὡς ἤκουσα, ὡς οἶμαι, ὡς
              λέγουσι</span>, etc. Thus, <span class="foreign">τόδε γε μήν, ὡς

              may precede and a finite verb follow (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.31.html#s2628" title="">2628</a>). </p>
            <p><b>h.</b> After a subordinate clause
              with parentheses the main clause sometimes follows in the form of an independent
              sentence (P.
                <span class="titlem">A.</span> 28c, cp. <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.1_div2.1.html#s36" title="TABLE OF THE CHIEF VOWEL GRADES">36</a> a). </p>
            <p><b>i.</b> An infinitive may resume the
              idea set forth by the principal verb; as <span class="foreign">τοῦ

                <span class="titlem">H.</span> 7.4.35. </p>
            <p><b>j.</b> Anacoluthon is sometimes due
              to the desire to maintain similarity of form between contrasted expressions; as
