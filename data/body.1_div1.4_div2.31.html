            <p>A subordinate clause may play the part of a substantive in relation to
              the main clause. Such clauses are generally the object, sometimes the subject, of the
              verb of the main clause. </p>

            <p>There are four main divisions of substantive clauses.</p>
            <p>1. <b>Dependent Statements:</b>

              done</i>. These clauses have been treated under the following divisions: </p>
            <p><b>a.</b> Dependent clauses after <span class="term">verbs of effort</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.29.html#s2209" title="">2209</a>). </p>

            <p>4. <b>Dependent Exclamations:</b>
              subordinate clauses setting forth an exclamation; both parts of the sentence together

              <p><b>a.</b> The use of past tenses of

              <p><b>b.</b> Such inserted statements of

                clause, the same past tense that would have been used in an independent clause, from
                the point of view of the speaker, and not the tense which would have been used in
                direct discourse from the point of view of the subject of the main clause. Thus,

              <p>Long sentences (and even some short complex sentences), or a series of
                sentences, in indirect discourse depending on a single <span class="term">verb of
                  saying</span> or <span class="term">thinking</span>, are uncongenial to the
                animated character of Greek, which resists the formal regularity of Latin. Some long
                speeches in indirect discourse do, however, appear, e.g. Andoc. 1. 3842, Thuc. 6.
                49, Xen. C. 8. 1. 10-11, Plato R. 614 b (the entire <i>Symposium</i> is given in reported form). To effect variety and to ensure
                clearness by relieving the strain on the leading verb, Greek has various devices. </p>
              <p><b>a.</b>
                <span class="foreign">ἔφη</span> (<span class="foreign">ἔλεξε, εἶπεν, ἤρετο</span>) is repeated, e.g. T.
                  7.48. </p>
              <p><b>b.</b> The indirect form is
                abandoned for the direct form, e.g. X.
                  <span class="titlem">A.</span> 1.3.14, 1. 9. 25, 4. 8. 10; often with a
                change, or repetition, of the <span class="term">verb of saying</span> (X.
                  <span class="titlem">A.</span> 5.6.37, X.
                  <span class="titlem">H.</span> 2.1.25). </p>
              <p><b>c.</b>
                <span class="foreign">ἔφη χρῆναι</span> (<span class="foreign">δεῖν</span>) or <span class="foreign">ἐκέλευσε</span> is inserted or repeated (T. 6.49. 4). </p>
              <p>N. 1.—Transition from direct to indirect discourse is rare (X.
                  <span class="titlem">A.</span> 7.1.39, cp. X.
                  <span class="titlem">C.</span> 3.2.25). </p>
              <p>N. 2.—An interrogative clause always depends immediately on the
                introductory verb, hence such clauses do not occur in the course of a long sentence
                in indirect discourse. </p>

                      fetch a payment due him. Rising early he mistook the time and set out, and
                      there was a full moon. When he was by the gateway of the sanctuary of
                      Dionysus, he saw a body of men coming down from the Odeum into the orchestra,
                      and through fear of them he betook himself into the shade and sat down between
                      the column and the block on which the Bronze General stands. He saw about
                      three hundred men, some standing round about in groups of fifteen, others in
                      groups of twenty. On seeing them in the moonlight he recognized the faces of
                      most. In the first place, gentlemen, he has concocted this most extraordinary
                      tale, in order, as I believe, that it might be in his power to include among
                      these men any Athenian he wished, or to exclude any he did not wish. On seeing
                      this he said he went to Laurium, and on the day after heard that the statues
                      of Hermes had been mutilated. So he knew forthwith that it was the work of
                      these men. On his return to the city he found that commissioners of inquiry
                      had already been appointed and that a hundred minae had been offered as a
                      reward.</td>
