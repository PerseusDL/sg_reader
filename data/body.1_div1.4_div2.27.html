          <div class="smythp" id="s2173"><h4>2173</h4>
            <p>A complex sentence consists of a principal sentence and one or more
              subordinate, or dependent, sentences. The principal sentence, as each subordinate
              sentence, has its own subject and predicate. The principal sentence of a complex
              sentence is called the principal clause, the subordinate sentence is called the
              subordinate clause. The principal clause may precede or follow the subordinate clause.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="smythp" id="s2174"><h4>2174</h4>
            <p>The principal clause may have any form of the simple sentence. </p>
            <p><b>a.</b> Parentheses belonging to the
              thought of the entire sentence, but standing in no close grammatical relation to it,
              count as principal clauses. So <span class="foreign">οἶμαι, δοκῶ,
                φημί, ὁρᾷς; οἶδα, οἶδ᾽ ὅτι</span>

          <div class="smythp" id="s2175"><h4>2175</h4>
            <p>The subordinate clause is always introduced by a subordinating
              conjunction, as <span class="foreign">εἰ</span>

          <div class="smythp" id="s2176"><h4>2176</h4>
            <p>A finite mood in a subordinate clause may be influenced by the tense of
              the principal clause. If the verb of the principal clause stands in a secondary tense,
              the verb of the subordinate clause is often optative instead of indicative or
              subjunctive, as it would have been after a primary tense. Dependence of mood after a
              secondary tense is never indicated by the subjunctive. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="smythp" id="s2177"><h4>2177</h4>
            <p>Each tense in a subordinate clause denotes stage of action; the <i>time</i> is only relative to that of the leading verb.
              A subordinate clause may be marked by change of person in verb and pronoun. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="smythp" id="s2178"><h4>2178</h4>
            <p>A subordinate clause in English may be expressed in Greek by a predicate
              adjective or substantive. Cp. <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.16.html#s1169" title="">1169</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.32.html#s2647" title="">2647</a>. </p>

            <div class="smythp" id="s2183"><h5>2183</h5>
              <p>The mood of a subordinate clause which is intimately connected with the
                thought of the clause on which it depends, is often assimilated to the mood of that
                clause. Such subordinate clauses may be simply dependent or sub-dependent (<a class="link_ref" href="body.1_div1.4_div2.27.html#s2180" title="">2180</a>). </p>
              <p><b>a.</b> This idiom is most marked in
                Unreal and Less Vivid Future conditions where the mood of the protasis is the same
                as that of the principal clause. It is also very common when a past indicative or an
                optative attracts the mood of a subordinate clause introduced by a relative word
                referring to indefinite persons or things or to an indefinite time or place. But
                subordinate clauses standing in a less close relation to the main clause, because
                they do not continue the same mental attitude but present a new shade of thought,
                retain their mood unassimilated; e.g. a relative clause, or a temporal clause
                expressing purpose, after an unreal condition may stand in the optative (Is.
                  4.11, P.
                  <span class="titlem">R.</span> 600e). On the other hand, there are many

                difference of meaning. The following sections give the chief occurrences of

              <p>N. 2.—Assimilation does not take place when the final clause is the
                essential thing and sets forth a real future purpose of the agent of the leading

                optative is used when the purpose of the agent, and not the non-fulfilment of the
                action, is emphasized. Thus,
