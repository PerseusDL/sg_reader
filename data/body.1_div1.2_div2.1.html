              <b>Parts of Speech</b>.—Greek has the following parts
              of speech: substantives, adjectives, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions,
              conjunctions, and particles. In this Grammar <i>noun</i> is used to include both the substantive and the adjective. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="smythp" id="s190"><h4>190</h4>
            <p>
              <b>Inflection</b> is the change in the form of nouns,
              pronouns, and verbs which indicates their relation to other words in the sentence.
                <i>Declension</i> is the inflection of
              substantives, adjectives (including participles), and pronouns; <i>conjugation</i> is the inflection of verbs. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="smythp" id="s191"><h4>191</h4>
            <p>
              <b>Stems</b>.—Inflection is shown by the addition of
              endings to the <i>stem</i>, which is that part of a
              word which sets forth the <i>idea;</i> the endings
              fit the word to stand in various relations to other words in the sentence. The endings
              originally had distinct meanings, which are now seldom apparent. In verbs they
              represent the force of the personal pronouns in English; in nouns they often
              correspond to the ideas expressed by <i>of</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>for</i>,
              etc. Thus, the stem <span class="foreign">λογο-</span> becomes
                <span class="foreign">λόγο-ς</span>
              <span class="gloss">word</span>, the stem <span class="foreign">λεγο-</span> becomes <span class="foreign">λέγο-μεν</span>
              <span class="gloss">we say</span>. Whether a stem is used as a noun or a verb
              depends solely on its signification; many stems are used both for nouns and for verbs,
              as <span class="foreign">τῑμᾱ-</span> in <span class="foreign">τῑμή</span>
              <span class="gloss">honour</span>, <span class="foreign">τῑμα-</span> in <span class="foreign">τῑμά-ω</span>
              <span class="gloss">I honour;</span>
              <span class="foreign">ἐλπιδ-</span> in <span class="foreign">ἐλπί</span>(<span class="foreign">δ</span>)<span class="foreign">-ς</span>
              <span class="gloss">hope</span>, <span class="foreign">ἐλπίζω</span>
              <span class="gloss">I hope</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐλπιδ-ιω</span>). The pure stem, that is, the stem without any ending, may serve
              as a word; as <span class="foreign">χώρᾱ</span>
              <span class="gloss">land</span>, <span class="foreign">λέγε</span>
              <span class="gloss">speak!</span>
              <span class="foreign">λόγε</span>
              <span class="gloss">oh word!</span>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="smythp" id="s192"><h4>192</h4>
            <p>The stem often changes in form, but not in meaning, in nouns and verbs.
              Thus, the stem of <span class="foreign">λόγο-ς</span>
              <span class="gloss">word</span> is <span class="foreign">λογο-</span> or <span class="foreign">λογε-</span>, of
                <span class="foreign">πατήρ</span>
              <span class="gloss">father</span> is <span class="foreign">πατερ-</span> (strong stem) or <span class="foreign">πατρ-</span> (weak stem); of <span class="foreign">λείπο-μεν</span>
              <span class="gloss">we leave</span> is <span class="foreign">λειπο-</span>, of <span class="foreign">ἐ-λίπομεν</span>
              <span class="gloss">we left</span> is <span class="foreign">λιπο-</span>. The verbal stem is also modified to indicate change in time:
                <span class="foreign">τῑμή-σο-μεν</span>
              <span class="gloss">we shall honour</span>. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="smythp" id="s193"><h4>193</h4>
            <p>
              <b>Roots</b>.—The fundamental part of a word, which
              remains after the word has been analyzed into all its component parts, is called a
                <i>root</i>. When a stem agrees in form with a root
              (as in <span class="foreign">ποδ-ός</span>, gen. of <span class="foreign">πούς</span>
              <span class="gloss">foot</span>) it is called a <i>root-stem</i>. A root contains the mere idea of a word in the vaguest and most
              abstract form possible. Thus, the root <span class="foreign">λεγ</span>, and in another form <span class="foreign">λογ</span>, contains the idea of <i>saying</i>
              simply. By the addition of a formative element <span class="foreign">ο</span> we arrive at the stems <span class="foreign">λεγο-</span> and <span class="foreign">λογο-</span> in
                <span class="foreign">λέγο-μεν</span>
              <span class="gloss">we say</span>, <span class="foreign">λόγο-ς</span>
              <span class="gloss">word</span> (i.e. what is said). <span id="smyth-pb-d0e19632"/>
              Words are built by adding to the root certain formative suffixes by which the stem and
              then the word, ready for use, is constructed. Thus, from the root <span class="foreign">λυ</span> are formed <span class="foreign">λύ-σι-ς</span>
              <span class="gloss">loosing</span>, <span class="foreign">λύ-τρο-ν</span>
              <span class="gloss">ransom</span>, <span class="foreign">λυ-τι-κό-ς</span>
              <span class="gloss">able to loose</span>, <span class="foreign">λυ-θῆ-ναι</span>
              <span class="gloss">to have loosed</span>. The formation of the stem by the
              addition of suffixes to the root is treated in Part III. The root itself may assume
              various forms without change of meaning, as <span class="foreign">λεγ</span> in <span class="foreign">λέγ-ο-μεν</span>
              <span class="gloss">we say</span>, <span class="foreign">λογ</span> in <span class="foreign">λόγ-ο-ς</span>
              <span class="gloss">word</span>. </p>
            <p>N.—Since Greek is connected with the other Indo-European languages, the
              roots which we establish in Greek by analysis of a word into its simplest form often
              reappear in the connected languages (p. 1, A). Thus, the root <span class="foreign">φερ</span> of <span class="foreign">φέρω</span>
              <span class="gloss">I bear</span> is seen in Sanskrit <span class="gloss">bhárāmi</span>, Lat. <i>fero</i>, Germ. <i>ge-bären</i>. The assumption of roots is merely a
              grammatical convenience in the analysis of word-forms, and their determination is part
              of comparative grammar. Roots and suffixes as such never existed as independent words
              in Greek, or indeed in any known period of the parent language from which Greek and
              the other Indo-European tongues are derived. The theory that all roots are
              monosyllables is ill supported. As far back as we can follow the history of the
              Indo-European languages we find only complete words; hence their analysis into
              component morphological elements is merely a scientific device for purposes of
              arrangement and classification. </p>
